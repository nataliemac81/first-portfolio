	<h2>What is Rails?</h2>
		<p>
		Rails is actually short for Ruby on Rails, an open source web application framework that uses the Ruby programming language. 
		</p>

		<p>Ruby is a framework for building websites and applications. Frameworks are awesome because they allow you to complete common tasks when building web applications. This is a good thing because there’s really no need to build your application totally from scratch.</p>

		<p>Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hansson—a programmer and partner at Basecamp (formerly 37 signals). Rails is an open source framework and has a wide community of programmers that contribute new features and updates.</p>

		<p>How about an example of how Rails can be helpful in cutting down on time? Let’s say you wanted to make a blog. Well, Rails has a cool feature called generators that create everything you need to work on a particular task. So, okay we want to create a new blog. To use this particular generator you would type this into the terminal: 

			<p><code>rails new blog.</code></p>

		<p>This will create a Rails application called Blog in a blog directory. The blog directory has auto-generated files and folders that make up the basic structure of a Rails app.</p>

		<p>A number of popular sites like Twitter and Hulu use Ruby on Rails.</p>
