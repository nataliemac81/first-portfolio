	<h2>Compassion</h2>
		<p>The times in my life where I've been happiest and the most satisfied, the value of compassion comes to mind.</p>

		<p>Compassion means so much to me because it connects me to every human being whether they be a stranger or close friend or family. Compassion allows me to remove focus from myself and tap into another person's emotional state.</p>

		<p>When I am being compassionate I can recognize that a person may be reacting to me with anger out of fear or desperation -- not necessarily because pf something I did or said. In turn, I feel most understood when someone can direct that same compassion my way and see all of my flaws and weaknesses without judgment. This compassion allows me to share and break down any walls that I build up to protect myself. There is real growth in compassion. It is the thing I find most connects me to other people.</p>

		<p>I would say that I most definitely strive to live up to this value daily so I'd rate myself a 5.</p>

		<p>The last topic someone asked for my advice on was a friend wanting to make a career change who was worried that they might be making the wrong decision. I told them to go for it. It's better to try and fail than not try and have regrets.</p>
